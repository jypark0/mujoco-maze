# mujoco-maze

Some maze environments for reinforcement learning (RL) based on [mujoco-py]
and [openai gym][gym].

This repo is forked from https://github.com/kngwyu/mujoco-maze and includes some custom environments like RegionUMaze, and WallRoom5x11. The ant agent is modified as well. It also includes goal-oriented versions of the environments. See `custom_maze_task.py` for the list of new environments.

See the original repo's [README](https://github.com/kngwyu/mujoco-maze/README.md) for usage information.
